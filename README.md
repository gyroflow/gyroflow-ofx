# Gyroflow OpenFX plugin

* Works with stabilization data exported with [gyroflow](http://gyroflow.xyz/)
* Allows you to apply the stabilization right in your OpenFX-capable video editor

# Installation

Grab the archive for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow-ofx/releases).

## Linux

    mkdir -p /usr/OFX/Plugins
    cd /usr/OFX/Plugins
    sudo unzip ${PATH_TO}/gyroflow-ofx-linux.zip

## MacOS

Copy the `GyroFlow.ofx.bundle` from the archive into the `/Library/OFX/Plugins` directory.
Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet.
You will probably need to open System Preferences -> Security and Allow plugin from unknown developer. Then restart Resolve.
Then in Resolve, make sure to go to Preferences -> Video plugins and enable GyroFlow.ofx.bundle.

## Windows

Copy the `GyroFlow.ofx.bundle` from the archive into the `C:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins` folder.
Create the folder if it doesn't exist yet.

# Usage

## With Gyroflow 1.0

### Export `.gyroflow` file in the Gyroflow app

Click the `Export .gyroflow file (including gyro data)` in the Gyroflow app.

### Basic plugin usage

First you need to apply the plugin to the clip.
In DaVinci Resolve you can do that by going to the Fusion tab and inserting the "Warp -> Gyroflow" after the media input node.
You can also apply the plugin on the Edit or Color page - it should work faster this way.

### Load the .gyroflow file

In DaVinci Resolve Fusion, go to the `Gyroflow` node settings. Select the `.gyroflow` file in the `Gyroflow file` entry.

## With Gyroflow 0.x

Please see an earlier version of this [README.md](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow-ofx/blob/82d31797ae586daac16e0a8b3b492a16af606f6c/README.md#with-gyroflow-0x)
